# CSS Select

This is a pure CSS and HTML implementation of the select form control element. It provides a consistent look and feel for all Browsers.

## Caveat
The Select will only close if a value is clicked
As the select will be position:absolute to not interfere with the current float context, it must be used with a width and height defined
When ever the select element is open, value="" will be assigned
You have to use checked for your default value
