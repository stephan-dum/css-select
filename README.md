# CSS Select

This is a pure CSS and HTML implementation of the select form control element. It provides a consistent look and feel for all Browsers.

## Caveat
- The `select` will only close if a value is clicked
- The `select` will be `position:absolute` to not interfere with the current float context
- When ever the `select` element is open, `value=""` will be assigned
- You have to use `checked` for your default value
